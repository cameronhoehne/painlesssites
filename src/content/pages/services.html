                    <span class="text-span">Building and managing your own website can be a pain.</span><br>Your business was born from a passion, and your website should reflect that. But with Wordpress or Squarespace's complicated setups, numerous plugins you have to keep on top of, and how you can't get that section to look just right &mdash; it can be a bit of a headache. Websites made using these builders also tend to be bloated, slowing down your site and impacting your SEO performance.</p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    At Painless Sites we offer an alternative: affordable, hand-coded websites that are pixel-perfect. No more "It's good enough". With no up-front cost, we deliver a professional website that matches your vision for how you want your customers to see your work.
                    <span class="text-span middle">Too good to be true?</span>
                    Anyone who promises to get you to Google's front page in months is lying to you. It's a process you invest in, not a switch you can turn on. That being said, our goal is to set you up for success so that your search ranking and reach only gets better with time. The best part is &mdash; you don't have to worry about any of it. You let us handle the website stuff, and you focus on running your business.
