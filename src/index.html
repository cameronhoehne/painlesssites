                Your brand is your business. To set yourself apart from the rest, you need a good first impression. Your website can be the face of your brand, and if it's set up right it can be all a customer needs to choose you over the others.

                <p class="cs-text">
                The best should be at the top. When a customer searches for your services, your website should be one of the first businesses that comes up. There's a lot of factors involved, but to get there at all you need your own website.

                A business page on a social media site is easy to manage, but incredibly limited. A website gives you total control over how your customers see your brand, and allows you a much better chance to make a sale on the first visit.

                Even in a world of low-to-no-code website builders, the most successful know to delegate tasks to those who know how to get them done. The time it takes to build or generate a website alongside the regular maintenance of keeping it running smoothly can quickly become overwhelming when you need to focus on what you do best - running your business.

                    I can highly recommend Painless Sites. Cameron took my ridiculously slow-to-load media-heavy wordpress site, and through his hand-coding magic made my website load super fastâ€¦ like 8 to 10 times faster! I was stunned and thrilled.

                    He was courteous and attentive to all my requests and input throughout the website-building process, and very easy to work with.

                    And, if an issue arose in the reconstruction of my site, he was tenacious in his efforts to identify and resolve the issue quickly and efficiently. I was very impressed with his knowledge and talent and work-ethicâ€¦ and his solid commitment to providing and tailor-fitting the best possible website to meet my companyâ€™s needs.

                    I highly recommend Painless Sites.
